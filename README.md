# Film Angels

Film Angels is the world's first angel investor group dedicated to funding independent films.  It connects the most promising new movie ventures with the most suitable individual investors, aka angels.  Modeled after leading angel networks, Film Angels has been discreetly active in Silicon Valley and beyond for over fifteen years.  Members of its local chapters in San Francisco, Palo Alto–Mountain View–San Jose, Los Angeles, New York City, and London have invested in dozens of productions.  

Founded by Wall Street investment banker–turned–entrepreneur Thomas Trenker and cofounded by Sand Hill Road venture capitalist Saad Khan of Garage Technology Ventures, Film Angels has grown into a go-to resource for Hollywood A-listers, Oscar winners/nominees, and rising stars looking to fund their independent films or personal projects outside the studio system.  Statistically, $5-10 million budgets represent the sweet spot of successful film finance.  They allow for first-rate, Academy Award–winning production values without precluding superior risk-adjusted ROIs.  Win-wins become not only possible but increasingly likely.  

The Wall Street Journal has written about Film Angels' success on its blog and in the newspaper's business section, as have other major publications (e.g., San Jose Mercury News, San Francisco Chronicle).  Film Angels regularly features such luminaries as Apple founder Steve Wozniak, AOL CEO Barry Schuler, Movielink CEO Jim Ramo, San Francisco Film Commission Executive Director Stefanie Coyote, '90s pop sensation Lance Bass, California Film Commissioner Hilary Armstrong, and many more.  Internet giant Google even opened its headquarters to Film Angels for an unprecedented pitch extravaganza headlined by legendary rock icon Carlos Santana and billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper.  

With up to 1,000 potential investors in attendance at a time, Film Angels meetings have served as a powerful platform for the in-person pitches of many celebrated filmmakers and famous actors, including Lori Petty ("League of Their Own," "Point Break," "Tank Girl," "Poker House"), Sean Astin ("Lord of the Rings," "Goonies," "Rudy"), David Lynch ("Twin Peaks," "Dune," "Mulholland Dr."), Matt Smith ("Doctor Who," "Womb"), Adrian Grenier ("Entourage," "Devil Wears Prada"), Peter Krause ("Parenthood," "Six Feet Under," "Truman Show"), Danny Glover ("Lethal Weapon 1-4," "Saw," "Color Purple," "2012," "Shooter"), David Arquette ("Scream," "Cougar Town"), Kristin Davis ("Sex and the City"), Frank Darabont ("Shawshank Redemption," "Walking Dead," "Green Mile," "Mist," "Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein"), Ajay Naidu ("Office Space," "Pi," "Bad Santa"), Ron Fricke ("Star Wars III," "Samsara," "Baraka"), Barrie Osborne ("Matrix," "Lord of the Rings," "Great Gatsby"), Eugene Roddenberry Jr. ("Star Trek," "Earth: Final Conflict"), and Ralph Guggenheim ("Toy Story").  Only accredited investors with an express interest in movies are invited to attend these pitch sessions and to participate in the presented investment opportunities.
